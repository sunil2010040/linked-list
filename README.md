The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance.
Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage. 

Insertion of a new element / Deletion of a existing element in an array of elements is expensive:
The room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted but in Linked list if we have the head node then we can traverse to any node through it and insert new node at the required position.
